# The first line of the input will be an integer M (1 ≤ M ≤ 1000). The second line of the input will
# be an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000). The remaining input gives the positive integers in the cells of
# the room with M rows and N columns. It consists of M lines where each line contains N positive
# integers, each less than or equal to 1 000 000, separated by single space

M = int(input)
